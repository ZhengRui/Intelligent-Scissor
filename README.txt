1- File->Open                     load an image and calculate the pixelnode graph and cost graph

2- Pixel Node Button              show Pixel Node graph

3- Cost Graph Button              show Cost Graph

4- Path Tree Button               show the path tree generated by Dijkstra's algorithm,
                                  the path tree will be generated only after user first click the image

5- Path Tree Animation CheckBox   if checked, show the process of generating the path tree

6- Minimum Path CheckBox          if checked, show the minimum path of current cursor point to
                                  the previous seed point, the green line is the minimum path from 
                                  current cursor point to previous seed point, the blue line is to find the point 
                                  (which is around the current cursor point but nearest to some edge) and show its minimum path; 
                                  if not checked, user can select the line segment
                                  and delete them, it's recommended to only delete the last line segment, otherwise
                                  it may have problem when saving the scissored image.

7- key shortcut:  press F = click Minimum Path CheckBox
                  press D = delete the chosen line segment
                  press B = put the seed back to the first seed point(close the path)
